# work-day-scheduler

## what was the goal of this project?

 - The goal of this project was to create a work day scheduler webpage that can help you know exactly what you have going on each hour of the day from 9am to 5pm and then on page refresh loads your previously inputed information. You can see what the current date and time is at the top of the page. As for the rest of the scheduler it works like this... First you enter anything you have going on that day in each of the correspondong hour blocks. After you enter in anything you then press the blue save button to the right of that specific time block depending on what time block you put that info in. This then saves what you have going on that day and upon page relead all of your previously entered info is still there. If you wish to delete something simply just delete the text and then click the corresponding blue save button to the right of that block. Lastly you will see that the page is color coded depending on the current hour... Grey = past hours before the current hour, Red = current hour, and Green = future hours after the current hour.
